# AIAA Illinois Tech
This repo is a contributtion to the Illinois Tech AIAA chapter project. As the teams lead and chief engineer I focus on the design, analysis and manufacturing a model aircraft for the annual AIAA-DBF competetion. My work involves sizing the aircraft, aerodyanmics, dynamic stabiliy, 6DOG simulation and optimazation. And from  adminsratibe side as a VP, I wrote the latex report, submit project proposals, design reports and oversee the project deadlines. Check out the chapter website [https://aiaa.iit.edu](https://aiaa.iit.edu) for more info. 

The [AIAA-DBF](https://www.aiaa.org/dbf) is a student lead design builld fly compettion sposored by the AIAA organisation. It started in 1996 by the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics, Aircraft Design, Design Engineering and Flight Test Technical Committees as an opportunity for university students to apply real-world aircraft design experience by giving them the opportunity to validate their analytic studies.
