% needs an overarching sentence to tie this together. "The components of all subsystems:propulsion, structures..."
All components will be tested prior to the contest during flight testing. The propulsion system will be evaluated first on a static motor test stand prior to test flights. In-flight data will be collected using the electronic speed controller to record the data points. A wing tip test will be conducted by attaching the aircraft to a ground-test fixture, placing the antenna on each section at a time. The proof of concept test flight will validate the aircraft configuration and wing sizing.
% probably need a newline here. also, Im fairly certain that the wingtip test and the antenna are not related. Split into two ideas.
Following each prototype cycle, results will be evaluated and improvements implemented into future iterations. Structural components will be evaluated through in-lab testing to verify structural integrity under anticipated in-flight loads. The final flight test will be conducted with the competition aircraft and will fully simulate all missions to ensure expected performance goals are met. Key performance parameters of interest are stability, lap time, and acceptable antenna lengths.
