%
IIT's team is student run and has a faculty advisor present to provide necessary guidance. The team is composed of multiple sub-teams that are each responsible for a major design component of the aircraft. Table \ref{tab:teams} describes the roles and skills utilized by each sub-team. A sub-team is led by a team lead who reports to the Project Manager and Lead Engineer (see Figure \ref{fig:teamstruc}). The Lead Engineer oversees all components of the design and ensures cohesion between all sub-team decisions. The Lead Engineer also reports progress and design decisions to the Project Manager. The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring the design progress stays on track, deadlines are being met, and team leads are focusing resources on appropriate tasks.

A Gantt chart, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gchart}, is maintained by the Project Manager to monitor project status and distribute resources accordingly. The schedule serves to determine task completion times, delays, and appropriate task order.
% Budget
\subsection{Budget}
    The project will be funded by the Illinois Institute of Technology Student Activity Fund (IIT-SAF) and from individual members of the team. IIT-SAF will fund the entirety of materials and components for testing, design, and approximately 70\% of the costs associated with travel to the competition. A summary of the expected expenses are shown in Table \ref{tab:budget}. The necessary machines and tools are available in IIT's Idea Shop and the AIAA-IIT lab which has been furnished by IIT-SAF.
    % The expected cost per student traveling to contest is \$95.
