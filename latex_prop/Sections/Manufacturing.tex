The team's manufacturing process is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:miles}. The team will be utilizing a CNC mill, laser cutter, and 3D printer to manufacture components. The aircraft will be constructed using balsa and plywood with a Monokote skin. The team will manufacture two proof of flight aircraft to determine the optimum aircraft system design and configuration. The Lead Engineer assists the structures sub-team in designing components based off of data provided by the sub-team leads. Design drawings are shared with all team members for manufacturing and assembly.
